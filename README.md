# myBlog
I completed this blog assignment for a class called ITIS 2300 - Web Based Application Developement that was offered by UNC Charlotte.

This basic website was supposed to have a home page, a small tutorial page, as well as a gallery page that originally had provided materials.  I later changed this to images that I saved inside of the repository.

You can see a live version of this website that is hosted by github [here.](https://mpachapa.github.io/myBlog/)
