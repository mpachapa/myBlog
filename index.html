	<h1>Home</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my first website created for ITIS 2300. I am writing this page using a text editor, html and css.
	By learning html, I'll be able to create interactive web pages and I hope to teach you something new as well.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions please contact me by going to <a href="about_us.html">About Us</a><br>
	
	<h2>An Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
	<p>In 1995, Brendan Eich created JavaScript so the Netscape browser could dynamically respond to user events. Foe example,
	the web page's content could change when the user clicked a button. JavaScript was standardized by Ecma International in 1997 and called ECMAScript.
	ECMAScript became the standardized language that has been improved many times over the years, and JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript. 
	The latest version of ECMAScript is version 7 (ES7) which was released in 2016. Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. 
	JavaScript is supported by every major web browser and makes web applications like Gmail and Google Maps possible.</p>
	<p>JavaScript is also popular outside of the web browser.  For example, Node.js, which runs JavaScript, is a popular technology for creating server-side web applications. 
	JavaScript is executed by an interpreter, which executes programming statements without first compiling the statements into machine language. Modern JavaScript interpreters 
	(also called JavaScript engines) use just-in-time (JIT) compilation to compile the JavaScript code at execution time into another format that can be executed quickly.</p>
